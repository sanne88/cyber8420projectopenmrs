### Part1: Use/Misuse Case Analysis

To generate use cases and misuse cases for our system of interest, we've undertaken an in-depth analysis of the openMRS application software. This analysis involved the identification of the core system features along with the associated actors and enabling systems. We've identified six main features as the focal points of our analysis:

1. **Login/Authentication**: This fundamental feature ensures secure access to the system, authenticating users and safeguarding sensitive information.

2. **Data Management**: The system's data management capability plays a pivotal role in handling and preserving patient information efficiently and securely.

3. **Patient Registration**: The patient registration feature is essential for capturing and organizing patient details, a critical aspect of healthcare record management.

4. **API Access**: The application's API access functionality allows for integration with external systems and services, necessitating robust security measures.
5. **Feature5**:
6. **Feature6**: 
   
   
   

For each of these features, we have created comprehensive use case and misuse case diagrams. These diagrams not only outline the existing functionalities of the system but also incorporate essential security considerations. These security measures are designed to preemptively address potential vulnerabilities and possible attacks, thereby ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the system's data and operations.
